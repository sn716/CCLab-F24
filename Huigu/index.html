                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>The unknown creatures discovered in Marven are named “Huigu”. They don’t like to move and they are always scattered in different places. They all look the same and are shaped the same…maybe they are one whole family.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Can be anywhere on Planet Marven.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Huigu is shaped like ice balls. They are all blue and they all look the same. They float around Marven freely and they are not scared of outsiders.</p>

                <span class="yellow"> I don’t know what they are and what they do, but I feel the cold air that they are spreading out. They seem to be little ice balls moving around. But they seem to not move unless they see something to eat……  What I know for sure is that they are not scared of humans….at least they are not scared of our space shuttle.
